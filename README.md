# RStudio_Notes
In this repo I create RStudio scripts with the main command (comments + example) for data management, web scraping and so on
Great thanks to Grant R. McDermott who provides a full course of data science for economists in his Git.

Feel free to add comments, commands and suggestions!

Thank you :)
